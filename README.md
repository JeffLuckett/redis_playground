# My Redis Playground.

Just a collection of toy apps I've built to explore various features of Redis in
Ruby / Rails.

While I attempt to use "good" cooding practices, none of these examples are
intended for Production use, nor are they expected to be examples of "Best
Practices" for use of the features they explore. No warranty exressed or
implied :grin:.

Much of the code here is borrowed/stolen/adapted/modified/inspired by many
resources around the web.  Apologies and thank-yous to those who's code I may
have plagiarized/bastardized/abused ... or ... possibly? ... improved.
## [Pubsub](https://github.com/JeffLuckett/redis_playground/tree/master/pubsub)

  Simple Publisher/Subsriber console apps to explore basic features of [Redis's
  Pub/Sub](https://redis.io/topics/pubsub) feature.
